# El_universo
This is my code for my website on space that I built with HTML and CSS. The language in which I wrote the web page is Spanish.

## Introduction
The following code is the result of the knowledge acquired in HTML and CSS during the Tecnolochicas Bootcamp 2023. The theme is the universe, so the objective of the page was for scientific education purposes.

## What did I build?
I made a simple web page using HTML and CSS languages. In HTML I added text, images, buttons, anchors and sections. In CSS I styled the size of the images, the color and format of the letters.
